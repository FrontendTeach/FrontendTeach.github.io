# FrontEnd Teach
This is a small project containing homeworks for HTML, CSS and JS.

Then end goal is to make a Tik Tak Toe game by applying the lessons learned by reading:
<br></br>
[Official HTML docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

[Official CSS docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css)

[Official JS docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
<br></br>
[W3Schools training for HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

[W3Schools training for CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

[W3Schools training for JS](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
<br></br>
After going through the documentation and through this homework, there will be knowledge gained
on how to develop a javascript application.

There are a lot of improvements that can be done to implement those results, and we will be going through each of them lesson by lesson.
